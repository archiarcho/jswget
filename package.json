In downlaod mode, When file with same name found in download path, jswget will try to resume the download.\n2. Cookie support, you can get cookie vars, or store and read automaticaly from a file path\n3. Upload mode\n4. Redirect follow\n5. Auth and OAuth computation\n6. Support for both HTTPS and HTTP\n7. Pipe request output stream\n8. Send POST data or raw data\n9. etc\n\n## Options\n\n```\n* the configuration are:\n *   url                #STRING url input with format [protocol]://[host]:[port]/[path]?[query]#[bookmark]\n *
